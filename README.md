# Sketchbook

Self portrait with code.

## Story

The main question behind this project was: *how do you teach a computer how to draw?* In order to answer it, we must first analyze how we (humans), draw:

When one is given an image and asked to sketch it, the first thing that individual will probably do is draw out the edges of the objects in the image => the outline. But, *how does the brain know this?* The reason for this is by understanding colors; particularly,  the concept of identifying the main blocks of color in an image and using the places where colors change as "borders".
